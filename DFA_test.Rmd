From the manual: 'It is normal in this type of analysis to standardize each time series by first
subtracting its mean and then dividing by its standard deviation (i.e., create
a z -score yâ‡¤t with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1)'
```{r}
Sigma = sqrt(apply(Count_transposed, 1, var, na.rm=TRUE))
y.bar = apply(Count_transposed, 1, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
#dat.z = (Count_transposed - y.bar) * (1/Sigma) #this line is not working
rownames(dat.z) = rownames(Count_transposed)
```
```{r}
#can i get it to work with a subset of the data?
subset <- read_csv("subset_test.csv")
subset<- subset %>% 
   mutate(uniqeid = row_number()) %>% #spread wasnt working unless there was an  'unique' id
   spread(Fine_Trophic, Count_m2) 

subset_transposed<- t(subset) 


Sigma = sqrt(apply(subset_transposed, 1, var, na.rm=TRUE))
y.bar = apply(subset_transposed, 1, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
dat.z = (subset_transposed - y.bar) * (1/Sigma) #this line is not working
